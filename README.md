# Toy Model Quantum Perceptron

one_d_toy_model_perceptron.py: This script embeds a training set consisting of two clusters of sequence of bits onto the quarter unit circle. It updates the weight vector by computing the square of its dot product with a random vector in one of the two clusters and comparing this value with the same value calculated using the two vectors corresponding to nudges of the weight vector in the +- theta direction (and updating accordingly).

bloch_sphere_perceptron.py: This script is an extension of the above idea to the Bloch sphere.
